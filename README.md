WEEK ONE TASK
  1. Guess The Number: Write a program where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20. 
  The user needs to guess what the number is. If the user guesses wrong, tell them their guess is either too high, or too low. 
  2. Password Generator: Write a program, which generates a random password for the user. Ask the user how long they want their password to be, and how many letters and numbers they want in their password. 
  Have a mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. The password should be a minimum of 6 characters long.
